Rfacebook: Access to Facebook API via R
---------

Initial release, click <a href="Rfacebook-manual.pdf">here</a> to read the documentation. Vignettes coming soon on my <a href="www.pablobarbera.com/blog">blog</a>.

This package provides a series of functions that allow R users to access Facebook's API to get information about users and posts, and collect public status updates that mention specific keywords.
